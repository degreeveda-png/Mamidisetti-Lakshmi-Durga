In this course you learn mathematical problem-solving (like calculus, algebra, equations), basic and modern physics (such as mechanics, optics, electricity and magnetism), and computer science (including programming, data structures, databases and operating systems). Over the three years you do both theory and practical lab work, and by the end you develop good logical thinking, problem-solving and programming skills that can help
         you go for higher studies (like M.Sc. or MCA) or jobs in IT, science and research fields.</p>
